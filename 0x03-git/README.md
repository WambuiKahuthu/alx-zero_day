# Git Commands

The purpose of this directory was to help me get familliar with some of the git commands.

The following are some of the commands that I learnt about and got to use in the making of this directory:

*git clone* - Makes a copy of an existing repository in one's local machine 

*git add* - Adds the changes made in the specified sub-directories or files within the working directory to the Git staging area

*git commit* - Records the changes in the resporitory

*git reset* - Enables one to recover from any mistake made after making a commit

*git push* - Updates the remote repository with local changes/commits

*git pull* - Updates the local repository with the changes made in the remote repository

*git branch* - Enables one to create, list, rename and delete branches

*git checkout* Enables one to switch to a different existing branch within the local repository
